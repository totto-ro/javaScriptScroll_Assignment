# Assignment: JavaScript Scroll
Fix the following runtime errors from the example code:

• The last character of each string in the words array doesn't show up.

• The blank spaces are not appearing correctly. The cursor does not correctly shift to the right on blank spaces, instead it pauses on the previous letter and jumps to the next letter.
